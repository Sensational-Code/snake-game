# snake-game
A rudimentary snake game side project I try to set aside ~25 minutes (1 pomodoro) a day to work on.

[Try it here](https://rawgit.com/Sensational-Code/snake-game/master/index.html)

## How to play
Use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` arrows to control the snake.

## Installing
Clone this repo and run a local web server to host the index.html.

#### On Mac/Linux:

```
cd <DIRECTORY_YOU_WANT>
git clone https://github.com/Sensational-Code/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT_NUMBER>
```

Replace <DIRECTORY_YOU_WANT> with your desired directory and <PORT_NUMBER> with your desired port number.

Then visit localhost:<PORT_NUMBER> in your web browser of choice.
