# snake-game
A rudimentary snake game side project I try to set aside ~25 minutes (1 pomodoro) a day to work on.

#### [Try it here](https://rawgit.com/Sensational-Code/snake-game/master/index.html)

## How to play
Control the snake to eat as much candy as you can to beat your high score!

Try not to collide with yourself or the walls, or you'll get a game over!

## Controls
Use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` arrows to control the snake.

To restart after a game over, click the game or press `SPACEBAR`.

## Installing
Clone this repo and run a local web server to host the index.html.

#### On Mac/Linux:

```
cd <DIRECTORY_YOU_WANT>
git clone https://github.com/Sensational-Code/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <PORT_NUMBER>
```

Replace <DIRECTORY_YOU_WANT> with your desired directory and <PORT_NUMBER> with your desired port number.

Then visit localhost:<PORT_NUMBER> in your web browser of choice.
